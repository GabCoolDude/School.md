I chose the song "Get Up, Stand Up" from the group "The Fabulous Wailers", which famously has Bob Marley as it's lead singer. This song tells people that they need to get up and fight for their rights instead of just accepting things the way they were. I chose this song because I like it and also because I didn't know that Bob Marley was in a group before i discovered this song and that made me interested in listening to it.

If i had to choose 1 verse, I would choose the 2nd verse which is

You see, most people think  
Great God will come from the skies  
Take away everything  
And make everybody feel high  
But if you know what life is worth  
You will look for yours on Earth  
And now you see the light  
You stand up for your rights

It says that if you just wait for God to act and change things, nothing will happen, you have to get out there and make your own changes.
