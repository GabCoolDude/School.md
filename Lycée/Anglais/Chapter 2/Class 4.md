# Fast Fashion and the environment

**Problems:**

- It needs 2400 gallons of water to make one pair of jeans
- Bad for the environment
- The amount of waste it produces
- The amount of ressources it requires
- The way we produce clothes
- 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions

**Solutions:**

- Buy used items
- Buy second-hand
- We want to keep clothes in use longer
