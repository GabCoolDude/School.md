# Etape 2

Give developed answers to each question, use lessons and the vocabulary seen in class.

Question 1:
- **Wellâ€¦ For me, fashion is not very important because, I don't really pay attention to what I wear, I just wear what looks cool to me and what fits me.**
- *Fashion has always been important to me, because it allows people to express their true identity and who they really are.*

Question 2:
- **Hmm... I haven't really paid much attention to that before. I think it would probably have to be a black or gray tracksuit.**
- *Interesting... I have multiple outfits that I like, but I'd have to say my two most favorite outfits are traditional outfits like kimonos and also suits.*

Question 3: 
- **Now that I think about it... I kinda use clothes to express who I think I really am, by wearing what looks cool to me.**
- *For once during this show, I agree with you. I use my clothes and my fashion as tools to say what I think and also to bring out my true identity.*

Question 4:
- **No, like I said before, I just use them to express my identity and nothing else.**
- *Of course, I use them to say what I think about culture, politics, controversial topics, etcetera...*

Question 5:
- **Uhh... I don't exactly know what fast fashion is, but if it allows me to get my clothes faster, then I'm all for it.**
- *Of course not, Fast Fashion is bad for the environment and it's also bad for the fashion industry in general.*
