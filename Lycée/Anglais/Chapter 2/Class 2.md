# The art of political dressing

- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's job is being a congresswoman.
- On her dress, are written the words "Tax the rich".
- I think it is a good way, because it is quite unique compared to the other forms of protest (protest, billboards, speeches, etc..).
- I find her choice brave and shocking because, In America, not a lot of people are for taxing the rich, and for doing this, she is getting a lot of hate from her political opponents.
