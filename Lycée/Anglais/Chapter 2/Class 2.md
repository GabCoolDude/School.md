# The art of political dressing

The message is:
- to **denounce** the **inequality** between the **poor** and the **rich**
- to defend the poor

This is a good way to protest because:
- the poor and the rich live in the same country
- it's a unique way to protest
- she **attacks** the **public figures** (= personnalit√©s publiques) and people with a lot of power
